                    <a href="http://minesweeperonline.com/" target="_blank"> The game of Minesweeper </a> has been around 
                    since the 1990s, but when to asked to code it for my Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 
                    class (my first computer science class), I was a lost dog on how the game was coded. 
                    Being the last assignment of the course, I was required to code Minesweeper with a 
                    partner in a language that I had spent the entire semester coding in: 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Racket</a>. 
                    The specialty behind this language is that Racket was developed in house by 
                    Northeastern University, using it to evenly level all first-year students as 
                    practically no-one had used it before taking the first-year C.S class. 
                    Even though I only had a semesters worth of experience using this new language, I 
                    was able to successfully work with my partner through pandemic conditions in order 
                    to program the classic game.
